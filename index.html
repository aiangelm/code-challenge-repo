        Hello! I am a senior at Winston-Salem State University in Winston-Salem, NC.
    </p>

    </p>
        I am majoring in Information Technology and my expected graduation date is May 2023.
        <br>I am currently enrolled in my school's 4+1 program or BS-MS program, 
        which will allow me to complete a Master's 
         <br> degree in Information Technology and Computer Science a year after finishing my Bachelor's degree.

        Fun Fact: I grew up with both of my great-grandparents around!
